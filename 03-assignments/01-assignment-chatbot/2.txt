**Basic Flow:**

1. **Trigger Event:** User initiates an order in FOM.
2. **Data Validation:** FOM validates order data, checks business rules, and verifies system state.
3. **System Processing:** FOM processes the order, updates order status, and initiates fulfillment.
4. **Integration Points:** FOM REST/SOAP services interact with OIC REST/SOAP services to initiate fulfillment.
5. **Business Logic Execution:** OIC executes business logic to update order status and initiate fulfillment.
6. **Data Persistence:** FOM and OIC update their respective databases with order status and fulfillment details.
7. **Response Generation:** FOM and OIC generate a response with order status and fulfillment details.

**Success Condition:**

	+ Order status updated in FOM
	+ Fulfillment initiated in OIC
	+ Order completed in FOM
* Data Integrity:
	+ Order data consistent across FOM and OIC
	+ Referential integrity maintained
* Performance Metrics:
	+ Response time < 2 seconds

* Integration Success:
	+ FOM and OIC services interact successfully
	+ Error handling implemented
* User Experience:
	+ Appropriate notifications sent to users
	+ UI updates with order status and fulfillment details

**Failure Condition:**

* **System Failures:**
	+ Service unavailability in FOM or OIC
	+ Timeout errors or connection issues
* **Data Validation Failures:**
	+ Invalid input data
	+ Constraint violations
	+ Missing required fields
* **Business Rule Violations:**
	+ Policy conflicts
	+ Approval rejections
	+ Workflow interruptions
* **Integration Failures:**
	+ External system errors
	+ Transformation failures
	+ Sync issues
* **Security Violations:**
	+ Authentication failures
	+ Authorization denials
	+ Audit violations
* **Performance Issues:**
	+ Timeout scenarios
	+ Resource constraints
	+ Concurrent access conflicts

**Post Condition:**

* **FOM State Changes:**
	+ Order status updated to Completed
	+ Line status updated to Completed
	+ Booking conditions updated to Valid
* **Data Synchronization:**
	+ Order data consistent across FOM and OIC
	+ Referential integrity maintained
* **Audit & Compliance:**
	+ Logged transactions in FOM and OIC
	+ Approval trails and change history
* **Notification & Communication:**
	+ Sent notifications to users
	+ Updated dashboards with order status and fulfillment details
* **Downstream Impact:**
	+ Triggered subsequent processes in OIC
	+ Enabled next workflow steps in FOM
