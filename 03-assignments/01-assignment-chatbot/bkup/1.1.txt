pre_condition: 
- EBS Order Management System must be integrated with Fusion Order Management System through API.
- EBS Order Management System must send order line split events to the Integration API.
- FOM System must be configured to receive order line split events from EBS.

basic_flow:
1. EBS Order Management System splits an order line and sends an order line split event to the Integration API.
2. The Integration API receives the order line split event and triggers a split order lines process in the FOM System.
3. The FOM System retrieves the order and its associated lines.
4. The FOM System splits the lines according to the EBS order line split event.
5. The FOM System updates the order and its lines to reflect the split.
6. The Integration API syncs the updated order and lines back to EBS Order Management System.

Success Condition:
- The order is successfully split in FOM System.
- The updated order and lines are synced back to EBS Order Management System.
- The order line split event is processed correctly by the Integration API and FOM System.

Failure Condition:
- The Integration API fails to receive the order line split event from EBS.
- FOM System fails to split the order lines due to a technical issue.
- The Integration API fails to sync the updated order and lines back to EBS.

Post Condition:
- The order is split in FOM System and synced back to EBS.
- The order line split event is processed and updated in both FOM System and EBS Order Management System.
- The Integration API continues to process and sync order line split events between FOM System and EBS.
